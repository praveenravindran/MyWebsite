					<h1> About<em> Me </em> !!</h1>
					<p id="professional-story">I started my Master's at Auburn in the fall of 2013, My advisor Dr.Vishwani Agrawal was a great mentor and his lectures on Computer Architecture and Advanced VLSI Design got me hooked onto Computer Engineering. After a couple of semesters at Auburn, I thought it would be great for my career if I learnt about Software Engineering and started taking courses online related to Data Structures, Algorithms and Web Development. As much as I enjoyed hardware engineering, I loved software development more, I was pretty decent at coding in Java before but then I got better, so I started doing software projects on my own and successfully implemented some as well. My project on the Sentiment Analysis of Tweets was by far the best work I've done( you can check it out in the github link).I want to keep getting better and better so I'll just keep on learning more and more.One step at a Time! </p>

					<p id="about-me">I <strong>LOVE </strong> travelling ! Before I came to the States to do my Master's, 						me and a bunch of friends had this amazing bike trip in Ladakh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, India at the 						south of the Himalayas. It was a life changing experience and I can't wait to make that trip again !! 						<br>I'm also a big fan of sports, supporter of Liverpool FC, Auburn Tigers and Chennai Super Kings, I 						love to play football( soccer as the Americans call it ) and love playing the guitar !</p>
